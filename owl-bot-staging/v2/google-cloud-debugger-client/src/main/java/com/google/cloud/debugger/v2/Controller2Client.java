/**
 * Service Description: The Controller service provides the API for orchestrating a collection of
 * debugger agents to perform debugging tasks. These agents are each attached to a process of an
 * application which may include one or more replicas.
 *
 * <p>The debugger agents register with the Controller to identify the application being debugged,
 * the Debuggee. All agents that register with the same data, represent the same Debuggee, and are
 * assigned the same `debuggee_id`.
 *
 * <p>The debugger agents call the Controller to retrieve the list of active Breakpoints. Agents
 * with the same `debuggee_id` get the same breakpoints list. An agent that can fulfill the
 * breakpoint request updates the Controller with the breakpoint result. The controller selects the
 * first result received and discards the rest of the results. Agents that poll again for active
 * breakpoints will no longer have the completed breakpoint in the list and should remove that
 * breakpoint from their attached process.
 *
 * <p>The Controller service does not provide a way to retrieve the results of a completed
 * breakpoint. This functionality is available using the Debugger service.
 *
 * <p>This class provides the ability to make remote calls to the backing service through method
 * calls that map to API methods. Sample code to get started:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * try (Controller2Client controller2Client = Controller2Client.create()) {
 *   Debuggee debuggee = Debuggee.newBuilder().build();
 *   RegisterDebuggeeResponse response = controller2Client.registerDebuggee(debuggee);
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Note: close() needs to be called on the Controller2Client object to clean up resources such as
 * threads. In the example above, try-with-resources is used, which automatically calls close().
 *
 * <p>The surface of this class includes several types of Java methods for each of the API's
 * methods:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li> A "flattened" method. With this type of method, the fields of the request type have been
 *       converted into function parameters. It may be the case that not all fields are available as
 *       parameters, and not every API method will have a flattened method entry point.
 *   <li> A "request object" method. This type of method only takes one parameter, a request object,
 *       which must be constructed before the call. Not every API method will have a request object
 *       method.
 *   <li> A "callable" method. This type of method takes no parameters and returns an immutable API
 *       callable object, which can be used to initiate calls to the service.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>See the individual methods for example code.
 *
 * <p>Many parameters require resource names to be formatted in a particular way. To assist with
 * these names, this class includes a format method for each type of name, and additionally a parse
 * method to extract the individual identifiers contained within names that are returned.
 *
 * <p>This class can be customized by passing in a custom instance of Controller2Settings to
 * create(). For example:
 *
 * <p>To customize credentials:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * Controller2Settings controller2Settings =
 *     Controller2Settings.newBuilder()
 *         .setCredentialsProvider(FixedCredentialsProvider.create(myCredentials))
 *         .build();
 * Controller2Client controller2Client = Controller2Client.create(controller2Settings);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>To customize the endpoint:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * Controller2Settings controller2Settings =
 *     Controller2Settings.newBuilder().setEndpoint(myEndpoint).build();
 * Controller2Client controller2Client = Controller2Client.create(controller2Settings);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Please refer to the GitHub repository's samples for more quickstart code snippets.
